In order to get list of notifications use `diaspy.notifications.Notifications()` object. 

Single notification (it should be obvious that it requires object of its own) is located in 
`diaspy.models.Notification()`.


----


To mark notification as `read` or `unread` use `Notification().mark()` method. 
It has only one parameter - `unread` which is boolean.
