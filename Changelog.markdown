## Changelog for `diaspy`, unofficla Diaspora\* API for Python

This changelog file follows few rules:

*   __rem__:    indicates removed features,
*   __new__:    indicates new features,
*   __upd__:    indicates updated features,
*   __dep__:    indicates deprecated features,

Deprecation means that in the next version feature will be removed.

Also, after every version there should be a brief note describing possible 
problems with migrating to it from older versions and usage of new features. 

Users can always read the manual and dcumentation to make themselves more knowledgeable and 
are encouraged to do so. They only need to remember that documentation is usually more 
up-to-date than manual and if conflicts appear they should follow the order:

*docstrings* -> *docs/* -> *manual/*
